# V2I-Adaptive-Speed-Control
Adaptive-Speed-Control for V2I


This work is dedicated to adaptive speed control under V2I communication.


The simulation framework of V2X is based on an open source simulator:

Todisco, V., Bartoletti, S., Campolo, C., Molinaro, A., Berthet, A. O., & Bazzi, A. (2021). Performance analysis of sidelink 5G-V2X mode 2 through an open-source simulator. IEEE Access, 9, 145648-145661.


The main reference for the adaptive speed control mechanism is:
