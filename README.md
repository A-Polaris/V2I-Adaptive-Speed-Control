# V2I-Adaptive-Speed-Control
Adaptive-Speed-Control for V2I
This work is dedicated to adaptive speed control under V2I communication.
The simulation framework of V2X is based on an open source simulator:https://github.com/V2Xgithub/WiLabV2Xsim.
The main reference for the adaptive speed control mechanism is: 
Yin, Jicheng, and Seung-Hoon Hwang. "Adaptive Speed Control Scheme Based on Congestion Level and Inter-Vehicle Distance." Electronics 13.13 (2024): 2678.
